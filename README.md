# Music And Dance
Using external microphone to detect beats in music (and other audio peaks), Cozmo can make different motion in reaction to different strength of beats. The current beat detection is not strictly real time, and it checks the recorded audio of previous ~0.3 seconds. Dances are not artistically designed, but we hope you can enjoy Cozmoâ€™s literal robot dance, as if baby is reacting to music.

## Dependencies
The modules required in addition to the `Cozmo` module are:

* pyaudio
